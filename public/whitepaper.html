        <h1>VibeCode Whitepaper</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Vision: Democratizing Creation</h2>
        <p>VibeCode exists to democratize software creation through AI. We believe that great ideas shouldn’t die in notebooks just because someone doesn’t know how to code. Our vision is to build a platform where anyone—from a dreamer in a dorm room to a hustler in a small town—can describe their idea in plain language and watch it become a real, working application instantly.</p>

        <h2>2. The Problem: Friction in Creation</h2>
        <p>The path from idea to application is filled with friction. It requires technical expertise, significant time, and often, a substantial financial investment. This friction means countless innovative ideas are never realized. VibeCode aims to remove these barriers entirely.</p>

        <h2>3. The Solution: Just Vibes → Value</h2>
        <p>Think Replit meets ChatGPT, but infused with empathy, accessibility, and a rebellious spirit. VibeCode empowers a new generation of indie founders, creators, and change-makers by offering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No-Code, AI-Powered Generation:</strong> Describe your app, and our AI builds it.</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Deployment:</strong> Launch your ideas on a free subdomain in seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> Your application is built on a scalable, robust foundation without you needing to manage it.</li>
            <li><strong>Community-First Collaboration:</strong> (Future) A space to share, fork, and collaborate on AI-generated applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We're not just building tools. We're sparking movements. Because the future doesn’t belong to the best coder. It belongs to the boldest builder—and we’re giving them the keys.</p>
