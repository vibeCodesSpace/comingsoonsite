# Gemini Project: comingsoonsite

This document outlines the process of creating the "coming soon" site for VibeCode, including the challenges faced and the solutions implemented.

## Project Goal

The goal was to create a simple, elegant, and professional "coming soon" page for VibeCode. The key requirements were:
- A specific color scheme (#FF5B7A and #5DE794).
- An animated starry background.
- A clear description of the VibeCode project.
- Buttons linking to a whitepaper and a contact email.
- A footer with social media links, legal pages, and a copyright notice.
- A physically-real, layered feel with a fixed background and footer.

## Development Process & Challenges

The development process involved several iterations to achieve the desired level of perfection.

### 1. Initial Scaffolding

The initial version of the site was created with a simple HTML and CSS structure. This included the basic text content, buttons, and the animated starry background.

### 2. Footer and Scrolling Issues

The first major challenge was the footer implementation. The initial approach used `position: absolute`, which worked for the fixed-height landing page but caused the footer to overlap the content on the longer, scrollable article pages.

The second attempt used `position: fixed`, which solved the overlap issue but created a new problem: the footer was always visible, taking up screen space on the article pages while scrolling. This was not the desired "physically-real" feel.

### 3. The Flexbox Solution

The final and correct solution was to implement a modern "sticky footer" layout using CSS Flexbox. This involved:
- Setting the `<body>` to `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column`.
- Setting the `<main>` content area to `flex-grow: 1`.

This approach ensures that on short pages (like the homepage), the main content area expands to fill the available space, pushing the footer to the bottom of the viewport. On long pages (like the articles), the footer is naturally pushed down by the content and only appears after the user has scrolled to the end. This provides a seamless and professional user experience on all devices.

### 4. Final Touches

The final version of the site includes:
- A clean, responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile.
- A consistent and elegant design across all pages.
- A robust and modern CSS structure that is easy to maintain and extend.
- All the content and links as requested by the user.

## Next Steps: Adding a Blog

Tomorrow, we will add a simple, elegant blog to the site. Here is the plan:

### 1. Create the Blog Index Page

- Create a new `blog.html` file in the `public` directory.
- This page will list all the blog posts, with the most recent at the top.
- Each list item will show the post title, a short summary, and the publication date.
- The design will be consistent with the existing article pages.

### 2. Create a Sample Blog Post

- Create a new directory named `posts` inside the `public` directory.
- Inside `posts`, create a sample blog post file, e.g., `2025-07-03-welcome-to-vibecode.html`.
- The post will have a title, a publication date, and some sample content.
- The post will be styled to match the other article pages.

### 3. Update the Main Navigation

- Add a "Blog" link to the main navigation on the `index.html` page, pointing to `public/blog.html`.

### 4. Automate the Blog Index (Future Enhancement)

- For a more advanced implementation, we can explore using a simple script to automatically generate the `blog.html` page by reading the contents of the `posts` directory. This would make adding new posts much easier in the long run.
